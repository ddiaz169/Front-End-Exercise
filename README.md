User Registration Form

I created a user registration form with the required inputs:
 - Full name
 - Email
 - Password
 - Occupation
 - State

All fields in the form were required and only one selection was allowed. Once a completed form was successfully submitted a message response was used to inform the user of a successful submission. 
I performed a GET request from an endpoint to populate the occupation and state select options. I then returned the form to an endpoint via a POST request with a JSON body.
I also used CSS styling to format and style the form with responsive design. 

I plan to continuously update and improve this form as I learn and grow as a developer.
